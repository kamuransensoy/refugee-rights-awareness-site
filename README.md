## Project Purpose

This app was developed to:

- Advocate for refugee rights through storytelling and digital engagement
- Practice **React**, **Spring Boot**, and full-stack architecture
- Learn UI/UX patterns, including theming, motion preferences, and modals
- Explore how technology can support social impact

---

## Live Features

- Petition form with real-time feedback and thank-you modal
- Analytics for signature totals and hometown breakdowns
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Embedded YouTube video
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Email confirmation via backend service

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **React Router** for multi-page navigation
- **Custom CSS** (light/dark themes, responsiveness, animations)

### Backend
- **Spring Boot (Java)** REST API
- **Spring Web + JPA** for data handling
- **H2 (in-memory database)** for development
- **EmailService** for sending confirmation emails
- **CORS** support for frontend-backend interaction

## How to Run Locally

### Backend (Spring Boot)
1. Open the backend folder in IntelliJ or VSCode
2. Run the Spring Boot application (`RefugeeRightsApplication.java`)
3. Make sure it runs on: `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend (React)
```bash
cd refugee_rights_react
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  
   ``bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/refugee-rights-awareness-site.git
   

2. Open the folder and launch `index.html` in your browser:
   - On Mac: `Cmd + O` in your browser to open the file
   - Or run a local server like Live Server in VS Code

3. Ensure all images (like `signed.jpg` and `celebration.png`) are in the same directory as the HTML

## Certificate of Completion

This project was created as part of the **Intro to Web Development Fall 2024 Course by CodePath**.

I completed the program and earned a certificate, demonstrating my proficiency in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** through the development of a simple awareness website.

Since then, I have expanded the project into a full-stack application using **React** and **Spring Boot**, incorporating real-time petition analytics, email confirmations, and backend integration, reflecting my continued growth and dedication to learning full-stack development.

CodePath is an incredible community that opens pathways into tech, and I am proud to be part of it!
